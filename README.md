Code examples for learning how to program with Clojure and Ruby.


# What we want to do

We want to implement a simple tool to download the latest news headings for the game
[League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com/).

News headings shall be downloaded from the following URL:

* [http://beta.eune.leagueoflegends.com/news/](http://beta.eune.leagueoflegends.com/news/)

The tool shall output a list of news headings, one record per line, in the format `<counter> => <heading>`.

Example output:

    1 => Champion-themed wards in store now
    2 => Champion Spotlight: Garen, the Might of Demacia
    3 => New free champion rotation (Season three: week 35)
    4 => Patch 3.12 Notes
    5 => Champion and skin sale: 01.10 - 04.10
    6 => Mayhem everywhere you look
    7 => New free champion rotation (Season three: week 34)
    8 => Champion Price Reduction
